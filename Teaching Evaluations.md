## Course assistant comments

- Best TF at Harvard
- Maybe the best TF I've ever had at Harvard. Give this man all the Derek Bok Center awards. Extremely helpful on Ed as well.
- The most prepared and dedicated section leader I've ever had!
- What an incredible section, probably the best one I've had at Harvard; it's not just rehashing the material from the previous week, but practicing it in a Joe–like way with the practice problems.
- Will is incredible!! Great at explaining and had a very organized section.
- Will was an amazing section TF so dedicated and knowledgable. His understanding of the course material made the class much more accessible and he did a fantastic job leading a section.
- Will's example problems are put together extremely well—I appreciated that they relate to real problems in the world, always go beyond surface–level content (e.g. include data or simulations even when we're discussing theory), are applicable to the homeworks, and require us to derive useful content. I didn't interact with Will too much outside of section, but my sense is he's extremely competent and not hard to consult on problems.
- Will is an awesome, responsible, and decent human being. I enjoyed his lecture and appreciated all of his help!
- Very helpful office hours and review session
- Absolute amazing. Will's final review session is totally on–point, relevant, good pacing, and well done.
- Without Will's exam reviews, I would have been lost. I really appreciated the time and energy put into his review sessions.
- I only went to Will's final review section—but it was so well–done and well–prepared that I had to give a review. He clearly cares so much about the class!
- I just watched Will's review session but just wanted to say it was really helpful and made studying way easier.
- The final review session was incredible!
