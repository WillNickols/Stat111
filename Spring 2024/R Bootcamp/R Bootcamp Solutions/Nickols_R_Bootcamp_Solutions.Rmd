# R Markdown and RMD files

The most common way to use R in this class will be in R Markdown (.Rmd) files. These can combine LaTeX type setting, R code chunks, and visual outputs. For example, you can write the following true statement:

$$\forall w, b, n\in\mathbb{W} \textrm{ such that } w\geq n \textrm{ and } b\geq n, \sum_{k=0}^n\frac{{{\binom{w}{k}}}{{\binom{b}{n-k}}}}{{\binom{w+b}{n}}}=1$$
(Why is this true?) Because it's the hypergeometric PMF.

1. Write a true statement with an integral.

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2/2}dx=\sqrt{2\pi}$$

# R with flow control

## While loops

If you doubted the first statement, you can verify it by adding an R chunk with code. To add a chunk, click on the green +C button up top and select R (or just type out the three ticks).

```{r}
w <- 10 # Sets w to 10
b = 20 # Sets b to 20, same as <-
n <- 15
total <- 0
k <- 0

while (k <= n) { # Run the statements inside the loop until k > n
  # Set the 'total' variable to itself plus the next term in the sum.
  total <- total + (choose(w, k) * choose(b, n-k)) / choose(w + b, n)
  
  # Increment k
  k <- k + 1
}

print(total)
```

To run the chunk, either hit `Command-Shift-Enter` (Mac) or hit the green arrow in the top right of the chunk. 

2. Write a loop that prints the integers from -5 to 5 inclusive.

```{r}
i = -5
while (i <= 5) {
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
}
```
## Manuals

In the earlier chunk, `choose` is an R function that calculates a binomial coefficient. You can run `?choose` to see more information about this function.

```{r, include=F}
?choose
```

You can also type `?choose` in the "Console" at the bottom of the screen to get the same effect without adding a chunk. In the console, you can also verify that variables outside of functions are stored in memory until explicitly removed or overwritten. For example, type `total` or `print(total)` into the console to see that it is still contains the value 1. This can be useful for debugging after running code chunks.

## For loops, vectorization, and sapply

We can also evaluate this sum four other ways. First we'll use a for loop:

```{r}
total <- 0

for (k in 0:n) { # For k = 0, then k = 1, ... finally k = n
  total <- total + (choose(w, k) * choose(b, n-k)) / choose(w + b, n)
}

print(total)
```

A `for` loop automatically increments `k` without an extra line to explicitly do so.

Second, we'll use a `while` loop with an `if` statement:

```{r}
total <- 0
k <- 0

while (TRUE) { # Run forever until broken
  total <- total + (choose(w, k) * choose(b, n-k)) / choose(w + b, n)
  
  k <- k + 1
  
  if (k > n) { # Break the while loop when k > n
    break
  }
}

print(total)
```

Third, we'll use vectorization. This is the best way to loop in R.

```{r}
k <- 0:n # Assign k to be a vector containing the elements 0 through n
print(k)
print(k[1:10]) # Print a subvector of the first 10 elements (R uses 1-based indexing)

# Use vectorization and sum over all the elements
total <- sum((choose(w, k) * choose(b, n-k)) / choose(w + b, n)) 

print(total)
```

Fourth, we'll create a function and apply it over a vector.

```{r}
# Create a function called single_hyper with k, w, b, and n as parameters
single_hyper <- function(k, w, b, n) {
  value_to_return <- (choose(w, k) * choose(b, n-k)) / choose(w + b, n)
  return (value_to_return) # Return the calculated value
}

# Apply the function single_hyper to each element in k and sum the result
total <- sum(sapply(k, single_hyper, w=w, b=b, n=n))

print(total)
```

3. Use a for loop, vectorization, and `sapply` to calculate $\sum_{i=1}^{1000}\frac{1}{i}$.

```{r}
total <- 0
for (i in 1:1000) {
  total <- total + 1/i
}
print(total)

print(sum(1/(1:1000)))

# Lambda function in R, you could also write out the function
print(sum(sapply(1:1000, function(x) {1/x})))
```

## R Functions and more vectorization

There are many other functions built in for R. For example, the function we just wrote already has a built-in version:

```{r}
k <- 0:15
total <- sum(dhyper(k, w, b, n))

print(total)
```

This function calculates the probability mass function of a hypergeometric with parameters $w, b,$ and $n$ evaluated at $k$. Basic operations are also vectorized in R:

```{r}
v1 <- c(2, 4, 6) # Create vector with 3 elements by hand
v2 <- seq(5, 6, 0.5) # All real numbers from 5 to 6 spaced by 0.5
print(v1 * v2)
```

A convenient (or annoying) feature of R is that vectorized operations will duplicate the smaller vector elements to match the length of the larger vector.

```{r}
# For example,
print(3 * 1:3)

# And also
v3 <- seq(5, 9, 0.5)
print(v1)
print(v3)
print(v1 * v3)

# But this throws a warning
v4 <- seq(5, 8, 0.5)
print(v1 * v4)
```

There is some thought that vectorization in R is always faster...
```{r}
now <- Sys.time() # Start timer
to_time <- 10^6
n <- 10
output <- vector(length = to_time)
for (i in 1:to_time) { # Multiply elements in a for loop
  output[i] <- i^2
}
print(difftime(Sys.time(), now))

now <- Sys.time()
output <- (1:to_time)^2 # Do vectorized multiplication of elements (in a good way)
print(difftime(Sys.time(), now))

now <- Sys.time()
# Do vectorized multiplication of elements (in a bad way)
output <- sapply(1:to_time, `^`, 2)
print(difftime(Sys.time(), now))
```

But using the `apply` functions doesn't give you much speed up. Unless there's a built-in vectorized method (which there usually is), a `for` loop is usually the cleanest way to write code.

4. Print the average of $1, 1/2, 1/3, \dots ,1/10^8$ in the fastest way you can. What is the limit of the mean of $1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$?

```{r, cache=T}
now <- Sys.time()
print(mean(1/(1:10^8)))
print(difftime(Sys.time(), now))
```

The limit is $0$. As shown [here](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2016/cmsc351-0101/harmonic.pdf), $\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{i}\leq \log_2(n+1)$. Then, by L'Hospital's rule, $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\log_2(n+1)}{n}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{(n+1)\ln(2)}\rightarrow0$. Thus, $$0<\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{i}\leq \frac{\log_2(n+1)}{n}\rightarrow 0$$
so $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{i}\rightarrow 0$ by the squeeze theorem.

## Knitting

Now is a good point to knit your code. Press `Command-Shift-K` or the blue knit button at the top.

Setting headers in your chunk can have helpful effects. For example, `cache=T` stores the chunk outputs when knitting so they don't have to run again unless you change the code. The option `warning=F` prevents ugly warning messages from appearing in your output. The option `echo=F` includes the code output but not the code. The option `eval=F` includes the code but not the output. The option `include=F` skips the chunk when knitting (no code or output).

```{r, cache=T, warning=F, echo=F}
print("Chunk was here")
```

# Importing data, working with data, and plotting

## Importing data

You can import data from a CSV (comma separated values) file to a `data.frame` as follows. If the data cannot be found, make sure you're in the right directory by right clicking `Nickols_R_Bootcamp.Rmd` at the top left and selecting "Set Working Directory."

```{r}
countries <- read.csv("data/country_stats.csv", check.names = F)
```

This section will deal with a data set of country-level statistics from [UNdata](https://data.un.org/) and [Varieties of Democracy](https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/).

A few columns will be useful for the following questions:

- `GDP`: GDP per capita
- `EducExpend`: Public expenditure on education (% of GDP)
- `Doctors`: Physicians (per 1000 population)

## Selecting rows and columns

You can select columns by name or by index:

```{r}
print(countries$GDP[1:10]) # Print the first 10 GDP per capitas
print(countries[,3][1:10]) # Same thing
```

The comma in the second line above is important. You can select rows by putting the number before the comma.
```{r}
print(countries[1,][1:3]) # First 3 columns of row 1
print(countries[1:5,1:3]) # First 3 columns of rows 1-5
```

You can also select rows by a condition.
```{r}
print(dim(countries)) # Original dimensions

# Subset the data frame to only countries with GDPs per capita of over $10000
print(dim(countries[countries$GDP > 10000,])) 
```

## Base R plots

The following code plots the relationship between log GDP and the number of doctors:
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # Place two plots side by side (1 row, 2 columns)
plot(log(countries$GDP), countries$Doctors)
hist(countries$GDP)
```

These are quite ugly, but we can make them prettier in `ggplot`.

## GGplot

The following chunk installs and loads the package `ggplot`. You'll need to install packages only once but load them in each file.
```{r}
if(!"ggplot2" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
library(ggplot2)

if(!"gridExtra" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("gridExtra")
}
library(gridExtra)
```

The following code creates the earlier plots, but prettier.

```{r, warning=F, fig.width= 6, fig.height=4}
# GDP per capita is x, Doctors is y
p1 <- ggplot(countries, aes(x = GDP, y = Doctors)) + 
  geom_point() + # Plot points
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = "y~x") + # Plot line
  # Log transform x axis and set break points
  scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log10', breaks = c(1000, 10000, 100000)) + 
  ylab("Doctors (per 1000)") + # Rename y axis
  xlab("GDP per capita") + # Rename x axis
  theme_bw() # Change background

p2 <- ggplot(countries, aes(x = GDP)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  xlab("GDP per capita") + 
  theme_bw()

# You can display individual plots by not assigning them to p1 or p2

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2) # Put plots side by side
```

5. Plot the relationship between education expenditures and doctors in countries with GDPs per capita of at least \$20,000.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
over_20 <- countries[countries$GDP > 20000,]
ggplot(over_20, aes(x = EducExpend, y = Doctors)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = "y~x") +
  xlab("Education expenditures as percentage of GDP") +
  ylab("Physicians (per 1000)") +
  theme_bw()
```

# Random number usage

One of the main benefits of R is its ability to generate and manipulate random numbers easily. Most common distributions are already ready to go. Make sure to set a seed so your code is reproducible. For example:

```{r}
set.seed(111)

n <- 1000
normals <- rnorm(n, 0, 1) # Generate 1000 standard normals
expos <- rexp(n, 1/2) # 1000 exponentials with rate 1/2 (mean 2)

# Create a data.frame with the normal and expontials in one column 
# and the names in another column
df <- data.frame("values" = c(normals, expos), 
                 "distributions" = rep(c("Normal", "Expo"), each = n))

ggplot(df, aes(x = values, fill = distributions)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position="identity", bins = 30) + 
  theme_bw()
```

You can also calculate summary statistics for the distributions:

```{r}
print(c(mean(normals), median(normals)))
print(summary(normals))
```

There are also quantile functions (they start with "q"), density functions (they start with "d"), and cumulative density functions (they start with "p").
```{r}
print(pnorm(-3:3))
print(qnorm(c(1 - (1-0.997)/2, 1 - (1-0.95)/2, 1 - (1-0.68)/2)))
```

(Which rule does the line above show?)  The 68-95-99.7 rule.

The functions `rep` is useful for repeating values, and the function `replicate` is useful for replicating computations.

```{r}
print(rep(10, 5))
print(replicate(10, mean(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 2))))
```

6. Show visually the law of large numbers applying to draws from $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.

```{r}
n <- 1000
normals <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)
running_mean <- function(i, x) { # Returns the mean of elements 1 to i of x
  return (mean(x[1:i]))
}

df <- data.frame(y=sapply(1:n, running_mean, normals), x = 1:n)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Number of draws") + 
  ylab("Mean")
```
